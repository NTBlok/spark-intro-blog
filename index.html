                          An RDD is a resilient distributed dataset, which is an abstraction of data partitioned across a cluster of nodes with a lineage graph that provides
                          instructions as to how it was created or can be re-created which provides it with the characteristic of
                          fault resilience.

                          Spark was designed for two main use cases in big data processing:  1) iterative machine learning

                                 Narrow dependencies occur when each partition of the parent RDD are used by only 1
                                 partition of the child RDD. Execution of narrow dependecies can be pipelined on one cluster node.
                                 Also, fault recovery is most efficient with narrow dependencies.  Wide dependencies occur when
                                 each partition of the parent RDD are used by multiple partitions of the child RDD.  RDD persistence
                                  or storage is often performed for RDDs of wide dependencies for more efficient fault recovery.

                                 Compare and contrast between RDD and MapReduce?

                                RDD and MapReduce have similarities in that they both involve data transformations performed on partitioned data.  However, they are different entities - one is data or an abstraction of data with a history of lineage (RDD), while the other is a programming paradigm for distributed data (MapReduce).  More specifically, an RDD is either an abstraction of partitioned data or partitioned data in-memory or stable storage.  RDD has a lineage map that basically is the set of instructions on how it was created from data transformations on parent RDD(s) or distributed data.  These data transformations may have happened similarly to transformations that happen in MapReduce. However in contrast, MapReduce is a programming paradigm where a mapper program to define key-value pairs is sent to partitioned data on a cluster of computer nodes.  Then a sort and shuffle procedure takes place followed by a reducer program sent to all of the newly sorted mapped key-value data partitions.  The reducer program performs final transformations to output a final non-partitioned dataset or value(s).

                                    Spark's job scheduler examines an RDDs lineage graph to compute job stages for the most efficient execution with as many pipelined transformations with narrow dependencies as possible and stage boundaries at wide dependencies. This is performed at the time that a user runs an action.
